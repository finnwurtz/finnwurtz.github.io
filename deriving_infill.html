                <h2>Seattle Gross Density</h2>
                <img src="sea_wa_gd_r.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Gross Density" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
                <p>To derive an infill growth index, we again start with gross household density, or the density of households per land area for each of the block groups in the study area. This first plot displays the gross household density distribution for each of the block groups analyzed in the Seattle test case, with the red zones containing the block groups with the highest densities and the blue zones containing the block groups with the lowest densities. Note that each set of zones that is shaded a given color contains approximately the same proportion of the study area’s households; hence, the total area of the red zones is much smaller than the total area of the blue zones.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Seattle Composite Density</h2>
                <img src="sea_wa_cd_r.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Composite Density" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
                <p>Next, we look at gross household density alongside composite density, which is itself a combination of gross household density, travelshed density, and demic unit radius values. I explain how I derive composite density on this page [LINK HERE]. This second plot displays the composite density distribution for the Seattle test case, with the red zones again containing the block groups with the highest densities and the blue zones again containing the block groups with the lowest densities.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Seattle Perceptual Offset</h2>
                <img src="sea_wa_po_r.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Perceptual Offset" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
                <p>We get our third variable, which I call 'perceptual offset,' by calculating the household-weighted distribution of block groups by gross density and the household-weighted distribution of block groups by composite density. The perceptual offset of a block group is the difference between a block group’s composite density quantile and its gross density quantile. Hence, block groups with lower gross household density values relative to their neighbors tend to have higher perceptual offset values. This third plot displays the perceptual offset distribution for the Seattle test case, with the red zones containing the block groups with the highest values and the blue zones containing the block groups with the lowest values.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Seattle Infill Growth Index</h2>
                <img src="sea_wa_igi_r.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Infill Growth Index" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
                <p>Finally, to get the infill growth index value of each block group, we average its household-weighted composite quantile value with its household-weighted perceptual offset quantile and take the quantile value of the result. It follows that the block groups with the highest infill growth index values tend to have both high composite density values and high perceptual offset values, meaning that they are surrounded by high-density block groups and are not as dense as their neighbors. This fourth plot displays the infill growth index distribution for the Seattle test case; as before, the red zones again containing the block groups with the highest values and the blue zones again containing the block groups with the lowest values.</p>
